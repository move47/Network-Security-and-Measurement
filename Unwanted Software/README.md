### 1) What are the main contributions of this paper (”Framing Dependencies Introduced by Underground Commoditization”)?

In this survey paper, the authors lay out the security framework needed to understand how
criminals make money off and their weak dependencies that are simple to disrupt. They point
out that making changes to the payment infrastructure in the value chain can make abuse less
likely. 

But the authors think that these conclusions are preliminary and more research is needed
to figure out how well these legal and financial solutions will work in the long run.

### 2) What parts of the paper (”Framing Dependencies Introduced by Underground Commoditization”) do you find unclear?

- The authors mostly says that instead of protecting the users/systems, the researchers or
industry should try to disrupt the infrastructure behind black markets- I think both are
essential in their own aspects and might vary on case-by-case basis.
- I didn’t understand the idea of search engine cloaking? and the ways to achieve it?
Aren’t tools like Google Safe Browsing stops form happening it?

### 3) What parts of the paper (”Framing Dependencies Introduced by UndergroundCommoditization”) are questionable? (That is, you think a conclusion may be wrong, an approach or evaluation technically flawed, or data ill-presented.)

- I didn’t see authors talk about how big tech companies commit or stop these kinds of
crimes. I think that some companies might be taking advantage of their users by using
third-party services, such as Pay-per-install, etc. So, I’m not sure authors focus on all
the criminals who are involved in underground markets.
- Moreover, I didn’t find the kind of techniques used behind the reported quantitative
data? Overall, I find it somewhat opaque in terms of technical details.

### 4) Outline a particular dependency of this paper (”Framing Dependencies Introduced by Underground Commoditization”) you found surprising or insightful. Why? How has it changed your thinking on the topic?

I was kinda shocked after reading this paper. I was unknown to the fact that we can buy services
to abuse someone. I had the notion that if an individual/organisation wants to target someone
then they need to start from scratch, however after reading this I understand that they can
buy pretty much everything at far lower cost than what they would spend if build from zero to
achieve the same final goal.

### 5) Based on the notions of unwanted software from the second paper (”Investigating Commercial Pay-Per-Install and the Distribution of Unwanted Software”), describe a concrete way the interplay between actors has changed in a way that makes such engagement 1) harder to disrupt, and 2) easier to disrupt.

I didn’t understand the question exactly. However, I am providing an explanation below on
whatever I understood. The main actors involved in unwanted software distribution are: adver-
tisers, PPI networks, and publishers. I think most PPI networks use publishers for final delivery,
so stopping publishers would break the whole chain. On the other hand, if the PPI networks
themselves are publishers, then they might hide themselves by advertising harmless services and
using other clever tricks.
